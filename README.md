## Coding Experience
My name is Peter Kollmar, a transfer student from Dutchess Community College that plans to graduate with my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the end of this semester. I received an Associate's in Computer Information Systems from DCC that has helped inform and prepare me for CS here at New Paltz. As part of the Curriculum at DCC I learned html, css, visual basic, bash, c, sql, and became familar with the visual studio development suite, culminating in the Capstone course for the CIS program. In that course I used Visual Studio’s Azure to create a number of different phone applications, varying from a food ordering application to a hiking route tracker. This also involved an introduction to Progressive Web Apps. Through the curriculum here at New Paltz, I became more familiar with Jave/Javascript, assembly, several other dev suites, and was introduced to some broader concepts that are part of the cs field. As part of the software development course offered here at New Paltz, I worked as the SCRUM Master of a group that produced a website that provides cooking recipes to users based of ingredients they submit to a search function or have stored in their “fridge”. I worked primarily on backend development of the database and the php files that handled progressive pages and database interactions.
## Expectations for this semester
This semester is an opportunity for me to look more at applied Computer Science. I’m taking Web Programming as one of two electives while I take Projects in order to finish my degree. I’ve completed all other requirements in the CS Program, and am looking to branching out as I prepare for looking at the work force once I graduate. I’m a non-traditional commuter student, so I have a lot of background that I bring into an educational environments from. In particular with Web Programming, I look forward to refamiliarizing myself with html/css, be more informed on contemporary web programming procedures, and have more experience with back-end development and maintenance.
